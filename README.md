### About Me üòÉ

I'm a junior back-end developer with a strong interest in web development and creating efficient solutions. 
I'm a 35 years young skateboarder born and bred in Venezia and exported in Barcelona in order to follow the life i always dreamed. 
I am a curious person, i like to learn skills and knowledge on my own, i always try to be a better version of the person i've used to be yesterday.
I love my doggo, slow mornings, coffee, music, camping, eating, sleeping, videogaming a bit. 
Of course, i'm currently based in Barcelona at the moment. 

I work as Investigation Specialist in Amazon Spain, supporting the italian market mainly but also any english speaking seller based in the EMEA region. 

I've recently finished an intensive 180 + 40 hrs bootcamp with IronHack for Java Back End Developer. (2025)
As i'm writing, i'm following a CS50 course from Harvard University in order to improve my general knowledge about computer scinece and i'm also studying basic knowledge of ethical hacking. 

I'm currently looking to find a job as Junior Java Back End Developer!
